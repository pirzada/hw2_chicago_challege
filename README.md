# hw2_chicago_challege
To Analyze the infants death against the prenatal care in different community areas of Chicago. 

The two basic findings would be: 

1. What is the correlation between them?
2. What is the effect of "Not Given Prenatal Care" (in percentage) to the infant deaths?
 
Best of Luck!
